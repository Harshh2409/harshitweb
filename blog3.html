    <h3 class="heading">What engenering colleges are doing wrong</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Every year around 10 to 12 lakh class 12th students give JEE exam fighting for 16,053 seats in IIT. The competition is cut throat. Those who dont qualify usually go for B Tech in private colleges. An average private college takes 8-10 lakh rupees for a B Tech. The curriculum in private colleges is outdated sticking to decades old way of creating engineers emphasising on assignments, vivas rather then practical knowledge. A student spends 4 years of his life in college which should be enough to make them industry ready which is not the case</p>
     <p>Colleges are not ready to move on with tge same pace with which the requirements of industry are changing some students who put extraordinary efforts  in college become star performers while others remain  nameless
        Shifting of colleges online has its benefits too students waste less amount of time as compared to colleges. They can compensate this time by using it in developing new skills.</p>
    <p>Another thing i think in which colleges lack is the ego's of some teachers. While many are helpful some are too rigid they don't bend the submission deadlines even for genuine cases which eventually leads to students wasting their time in completing pointless assignments. Which most of them just copy paste.I feel Areas where colleges are 
        1) Reduce assignments 
        2)Encourage innovation new ideas
        3)emphasize on practical knowledge 
        4)inculcate a culture of logic building 
        5)introduce students to platforms like code chef, Hackerrank.
        6) Don't be rigid ask teachers to  go easy on students</p>
