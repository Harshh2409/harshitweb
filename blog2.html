    <p>Why i prefer Java over other languages as a beginner
        I took up java as an optional subject in school for me it's the language that made me fell in love with programming, logic building.
        After java i learned c in my first year of college the syntax was different ofcourse but there was hardly any difference between major components of both languages.</p>
     <p>Once you know java c, c++ and python feel super easy to learn the syntax isn't that hard plus it will take hardly 10,15 days yo be fluent in other languages once you have got a hold of core java. Solving basic programs like palindrome, Armstrong number and pattern problems help alot. The main problem any beginner faces id dealing with syntax and once you know java you won't face much difficulty in dealing with syntax of c and c++ as java has most complex syntax of all. Go for hacker rank after learning basics of java hacker rank helps a lot in logic building.</p>
    <p>It is always easy to switch from java to other programming languages. Another thing for beginners specifically those who are in schools is to select c++, ip or java in your school im class 10th as it goes a long way. The sooner you learn the syntax the longer it will help you. If you want to pursue coding as a career after school go for it,you will have an edge over others as only few look at the larger picture students tend to think about the marks they can score in other subjects while taking optional subjects.It's how learnt java in my class 10th i took it as an optional subject used to love doing logical questions.the basic questions inculcate a culture of problem solving in you</p>
