    <h2 class="blog1h2">How India Annexed The Home Of Cricket</h2>
<hr>
<div class="blog1para"> It was 3 o clock in the afternoon. Virat kohli and Joe root were in the middle for the toss. Joe won the toss and virat just lost his 8th consecutive toss in England. Root decided to field first, after half hour Indian openers Rohit Sharma and KL rahul put on what could only be described as a fantastic show with the bat as they gave India a 100+ opening partnership. While the openers were in the form of their lives, the case with middle order batsmen wasn't same Cheteshwar, Virat, Ajinkya were struggling and soon departed without adding substantial runs on day 1. On day 2 and 3 only one player stood out and that was Joe Root who scored an unbeaten 180 at Stumps on day 3. However this was overshadowed by an infamous 10 ball over bowled by Jasprit Bumrah.

    Who knew that Bumrah's over has set in motion some intresting turn of events. The  10 ball over had a bunch of short balls to Anderson. Bowling short balls to mop up the tail isn't unheard of but English men seemed to be offended by it as they considered Jimmy Anderson incapable to face those balls, while Root could have declared anytime as he was with Anderson on the non striker's end but he didn't certainly he didn't find Jimmy incapable.
    
    On day 4 Rahul was dismissed early which exposed our struggling middle order to the new ball Ajinkya was the highest scorer for India in the second innings, Rishabh Pant and Ishant Sharma were to resume tomorrow. It was a out and out dominant performance from England almost everyone considered them favourites for the win as India had a long tail but little did we know what was in store for us.
    <br>
    <br> On day 5 Rishabh was dismissed early soon after him Ishant was dismissed too. Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah were in the middle now and things had started heating up as the English bowlers had decided to trouble Jasprit Bumrah for bowling short to Anderson. Jasprit was hit on the helmet a couple of times got into an argument with Jos Butler, Mark Wood. Umpires were stepping in again and again scenes were chaotic. After drinks Bumrah hit Mark Wood through the covers which went for four and the entire Indian dressing stood up in support they were trying to give Bumrah some support realising that he is under tremendous pressure from England Bowlers and fielders.
     The barrage of short balls seemed to upset the rhythm of English bowlers as they had more fielders on the boundary for a guy who averages 3 then they had for Rishabh Pant. The short balls helped the Indian batters to settle down by the time they got comfortable they started hitting proper cricketing shots Root decided to bowl Moeen but shami brought up his 50 by smacking Ali for 4,4,6 in an over the cheer fron the dressing room was loud enough to realise how valuable these runs were. Shami and Bumrah were welcomed by a defeaning cheer from Indian management and players at lunch.
    <br>
    <br>Virat Kohli the Indian Captain didn't declare in contrast to popular believe. Shami and Bumrah came out and batted for 3 balls before being called in by the captains.
    After the declaration the Indian captain was seen telling the players that "these 60 overs we should field like hell"
    Jasprit Bumrah was opening the bowling and he straight away went for the short ball it wasn't a ball in his hands it was a hand grenade he was breathing fire in addition to this the English openers were under tremendous pressure from the Indian fielders who were determined on taking shots at them for what they did to Shami and Bumrah. Rory Burns was dismissed in the first over by Bumrah and soon after him Sibley followed who was dismissed by Shami in thw successive over. The match looked like it was happening in Wankhade not Lords despite being at home England weren't getting much support from the crowds. The cheer each wicket got was defeaning. After Sibley the English captain came in and everyone seem to knew that if india were ti win this match his wicket was the biggest for he had been carrying this fragile batting all along. Root tried to steady the ship but wickets kept falling at the other end as Johnny Bairstow was dismissed just at the stroke of the tea by Ishant Sharma.

    <br>One Last session was remaining India had to take 5 wickets in order to win this match. If England managed to survive it would be a draw the question of chasing the target was long gone. In the first over after tea Jasprit Bumrah dismissed Joe root, Virat kohli took the catch and he was absolutely delighted as he took off in celebration.
    Jos Butler and Moeen Ali were in next they tried to steady the ship but Mohammed Siraj got the breakthrough as he dismissed Ali and Sam Curran on successive deliveries and everyone knew India now were touching distance away from a victory which will be celebrated for ages. Olie Robinson who contributed with the ball had to now contribute with the bat. He was dismissed by Bumrah and soon after him Jos Butler who was fighting hard. James Anderson came out to bat and Mohammed Siraj was bowling, the first delivery he faced he defended well but the second delivery knocked the bail of his off stump and the indian players and the crowd broke off in celebration Siraj took the off stump in celebration. 
    The victory was a classic case of never to lose hope England were clear favorites to win the match but to turn things around in that dramatic fashion showed the character and resilience of this team</div>
